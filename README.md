# Guess-The-Number-Game
The computer will think of a secret number from 1 to 20 and ask the user to guess it. After each guess, the computer will tell the user whether the number is too high or too low. The user wins if they can guess the number within six tries.  This is a good game to code because it covers many programming concepts in a short program.
